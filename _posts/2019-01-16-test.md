For each crawl there exists a directory named after the (approximate)
crawl date in the format `YYYY-MM`. Each of these directories contains
the WARC files and a subdirectory `derived-data` which contains CDX
files in the subdirectory `cdx`. Crawl `2013-12` additionally contains 
directory structure `subset-data/warcs`.
