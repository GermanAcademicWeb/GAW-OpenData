## About GAW

Our goal since 2012 is to create every six months an archive of the German Academic Web, including all institutions with the right to award doctorates and two of the big German research organizations, the Max Planck and Fraunhofer institutes.

To achive it, we use an instance of [Heritrix](https://github.com/internetarchive/heritrix3).

### Basic Statistics

The following table shows some statistics about the crawled data in the GAW-project:

## About REGIO

Science and innovation is affected by local interaction: Participants tend to cooperate with their "neighbors", where "neighbors" can refer both to regional nearness and proximity in other dimensions. The goal of the project funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research is to accomplish a better understanding of "nearness", especially the impact of geographical and thematic proximity, on the creation and success of interaction in public science and private R&D.
