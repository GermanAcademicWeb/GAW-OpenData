## About GAW

Our goal since 2012 is to create every six months an archive of the
German Academic Web, including all institutions with the right to
award doctorates and two of the big German research organizations, the
Max Planck and Fraunhofer institutes.

To achive it, we use an instance of [Heritrix](https://github.com/internetarchive/heritrix3).

## About REGIO

Science and innovation is affected by local interaction: Participants
tend to cooperate with their "neighbors", where "neighbors" can refer
both to regional nearness and proximity in other dimensions. The goal
of the [REGIO project](https://www.regio-project.org/) funded by the
Federal Ministry of Education and Research is to accomplish a better
understanding of "nearness", especially the impact of geographical and
thematic proximity, on the creation and success of interaction in
public science and private R&D.
